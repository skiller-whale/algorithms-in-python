Skiller Whale, Exercises for Algorithms in Python

This repo includes exercises to accompany Skiller Whale sessions on algorithms in python.

During each session you'll be asked to write and edit code in some of the files.

The sync.py script is used to share your files with the person leading the session, so that they can see the code you're writing, and help out when needed.
